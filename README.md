# Project 2 in imt2291 - Web Technology

## Introduction

The focus of this project was to set up a frontend in Polymer built on the PHP code from [project 1](https://github.com/tholok97/imt2291-project1). The old PHP code is turned into an API that our new frontend can communicate with.

## Authors

* Yngve Hestem
* Kristian Sigtbakken Holm
* Thomas LÃ¸kkeborg

## Documentation

Documentation is found in the Bitbucket wiki. If you are watching from Github, most of the documentation can be found under [`backend/docs/`](./backend/docs) and [`frontend/docs/`](./frontend/docs).

## Notes

* **Github is more strict than Bitbucket around Markdown**, so some of the documentation might look strange when viewed from Github.
* **The frontend documentation includes some very large images**. Although we'd prefer to have compressed them before pushing, the damage is done. Because we're done with the project, we are not prioritizing a fix. (Shameless plug: I'm working on [an app](https://github.com/tholok97/github_sketch_uploader) that helps avoid this problem).
* **We did not finish all the aspects of this project**. Notably the `video-player` component is missing some essential functionality.
* **The README found in `backend/` is that from project 1**. We did not prioritize updating it. Note that to be able to run this project you'll have to supply the config file described there.
* **The README found in `frontend/` is an auto-generated Polymer one**. We did not prioritize updating it.
